## Possible assumptions :
- The project is to only create an api not a front end application to consume the api.
### Agent List Page:
- "Return List of all agents" would be to return the name of all agents not all data of all agents.
### Agent Detail Page:
- "Update Any/All Fields by Agent's INT ID" request would include an agent object with _id property and optional other fields
### Agent's Customer Detail Page
- "Return all customer data from our system" the request will be given a customer id and return all information for a that single customer
